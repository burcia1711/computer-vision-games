# Computer Vision Games with Pygame

Welcome to my learning repository!  

This repo is for building simple computer vision-based games using **Pygame**, gradually moving towards **OpenCV**-powered interactions. 

Each folder demonstrates different features, mechanics, and interactions commonly used in game development and vision-driven applications.

## 📂 Repo Structure

- **background/** — Handling game backgrounds, loading and displaying scenes.
- **basic/** — Basic game screen, loops, and fundamental mechanics.
- **collision_detection/** — Detecting collisions between objects, boundaries, and players.
- **game_border/** — Setting up and managing game boundaries.
- **hand model/** - Hand tracking and landmark.

- **images/** — Handling images (sprites, backgrounds, icons, etc.) throughout the games.
- **keyboard/** — Implementing keyboard input for player controls and actions.
- **mouse/** — Implementing mouse input and getting coordinates.
- **music/** — Adding background music, sound effects, and audio feedback to the games.
- **read & show/** - Image reading, showing and other basic operations using OpenCV.
- **text/** — Displaying text elements (such as scores, messages, and UI) inside games.

## 🚀 Current Features

- 🎮 Game mechanics built from scratch with Pygame.
- 🖼️ Integration of images.
- 🎵 Music and sound management.
- 🧠 Collision detection.
- ⌨️ Keyboard and mouse event handling.
- 🧱 Game border creation.
- 📝 Text and font rendering.

## 📚 Purpose

This repository is part of my personal learning journey on:

- **Computer Vision** 🌟
- **Interactive Games** 🎮
- **Camera-Based Applications** 📷
- **Python Game Development** 🐍

I'm starting from the basics of Pygame and moving toward integrating OpenCV for more **dynamic, vision-driven gameplay**.

## 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)
- [OpenCV (cv2)](https://opencv.org/)  

Install necessary packages:

```bash
pip install pygame opencv-python
```

## 🌟 Future Goals

- Full hand gesture control for mini-games
- Object tracking as a controller input
- Game mechanics based purely on computer vision without keyboard/mouse
- Create a simple mini-game fully controlled by your webcam 🎮

# 🎯 Stay tuned as I continue building!
